# Welcome to OpenScPCA

OpenScPCA is an open, collaborative project to analyze data from the Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA) Portal, which currently holds 500 samples from over 50 pediatric cancer types. 

This project aims to 

- Characterize the ScPCA data with analyses like:
    - Labeling cell types
    - Completing descriptive analyses
    - Identifying recurrent cell states in multiple tumor types

- Refine approaches in the open.

- Build consensus around usage, strengths, and pitfalls of methods. 

The primary platform for the project is Linux.
The documentation and analyses modules cater mainly to Linux and Mac platforms.

If you would like support for Windows, please [file an issue](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/issues/new?assignees=&labels=docs-request&projects=&template=04-docs-request.yml&title=Docs+request%3A) to request for support and associated docs.

Whether you are a disease expert, a seasoned computational biologist or looking to hone your data analysis skills, we welcome your contributions to OpenScPCA!
