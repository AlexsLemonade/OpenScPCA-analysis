# Welcome to OpenScPCA

OpenScPCA is an open, collaborative project to analyze data from the Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA) Portal, which currently holds 500 samples from over 50 pediatric cancer types. 
This project aims to characterize the ScPCA data by:

- Labeling cell types
- Completing descriptive analyses
- Identifying recurrent cell states in multiple tumor types


## How it works

TODO: ADD ILLUSTRATION

**Co-develop analysis ideas and approaches**

Participate in discussions with Data Lab members and other contributors to shape analysis ideas and select the best approaches to implement analyses.

**Write reproducible code to perform analyses**

Work on an analysis module within a reproducible research framework setup for you by the Data Lab using R or Python.

**Participate in the analytical code review process**

Participate in the code review process to improve your programming skills and gain experience collaborating on a code base.

**Add your analyses to the project**

Contribute your analysis to benefit the broader pediatric cancer community and build your publicly-facing portfolio of source code contributions.


## Benefits of Participating

**Access to data and tools**

Discover new datasets to advance your research and learn how to use powerful tooling for reproducible research and software development.

**Join a supportive community**

Connect with the Data Lab and receive ongoing support from our team throughout the project. Meet potential collaborators with diverse skill sets and a variety of expertise!

**Develop skills and gain experience**

Build your analysis portfolio, develop transferable skills in big data analysis, and gain experience working collaboratively in a large code base. 

**Contribute to impactful research**

Contribute to open science and help build a resource that will benefit a broad community of pediatric cancer researchers. Plus you may be part of a future publication!
