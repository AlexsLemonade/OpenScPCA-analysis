## Determining and Managing Requirements for Your Analysis

When performing an analysis, there are two sets of requirements to be aware of and surface:

1. Software requirements
1. Compute requirements

**Software requirements**, often called dependencies, refer to the collection of software languages, packages, or libraries required for your analysis to run.
Tracking and reporting dependencies is important so that others can run your code and reproduce your results.
See [Software Requirements](determining-software-requirements.md) section for approaches to track and manage dependencies.

**Compute requirements** refer to the computational resources, such as the number of CPUs or the amount of RAM, that are required for your analysis to run.
Gathering information about compute requirements helps us identify the computational resources we should use on Amazon Web Services.
See [Compute Requirements](determining-compute-requirements.md) section for approaches to determine required computational resources.
