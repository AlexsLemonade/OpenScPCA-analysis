# Determining and Managing Requirements

When performing an analysis, there are two sets of requirements to be aware of and surface:

1. Software requirements
1. Compute requirements

**Software requirements**, often called dependencies, refer to the collection of software languages, packages, or libraries required for your analysis to run.
Tracking and reporting dependencies is important so that others can run your code and reproduce your results.
In the [Software Requirements](software-requirements.md) section, we describe several approaches for tracking and managing dependencies.

**Compute requirements** refer to the computational resources, such as the number of CPUs or the amount of RAM, that are required for your analysis to run.
Gathering information about compute requirements helps us identify the computational resources we should use on Amazon Web Services.
We discuss determining required computational resources in the [Compute Requirements](STUB_LINK) section.
