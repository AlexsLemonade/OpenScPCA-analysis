# Determining and Managing Requirements

When performing an analysis, there are two sets of requirements to be aware of:

1. Software requirements
1. Compute requirements

Software requirements, often called dependencies, refer to collection of software languages, packages, or libraries that are required for your analysis to run.
To allow others to run your code and reproduce your results, it is important to keep track of and report its dependencies.
We describe several approaches for tracking and managing dependencies in the [Software Requirements](STUB_LINK) section.

Compute requirements refer to the computational resources such as number of CPUs or amount of RAM that are required for your analysis to run.
Gathering information about compute requirements helps us identify the computational resources we should use on Amazon Web Services.
We discuss determining required computational resources in the [Compute Requirements](STUB_LINK) section.
