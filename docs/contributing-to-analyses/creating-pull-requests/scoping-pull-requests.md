# Scoping a pull request

## What to include in a pull request

When filing a PR, the content should be focused and contain a set of related changes.
For most cases, each PR should contain changes that address one [issue filed in the repository](../../communications-tools/github-issues/what-are-github-issues-and-how-do-we-use-them.md).

Keeping PRs focused on one task can help by combatting reviewer fatigue and keeping the [review process](STUB-LINK to review) short.
The smaller the PR, the faster the review!

For example, if you are working on adding an [analyses module](STUB-LINK to analysis modules), you may file the following PRs:

- The first PR would include [initiating the analysis module](STUB-LINK to creating analysis module), including the skeleton of the module directory and a description in the `README.md` file.
- The second PR may include a script (and any accompanying documentation) that performs the first step of the analysis.
- Subsequent PRs can add in any additional scripts, where each PR adds a single step in the analysis.
