# Code review and merging your pull request

Once you have submitted your [pull request (PR)](../creating-pull-requests/index.md), your PR will be reviewed by a Data Lab team member.
We will review your code contribution by:

- Checking for correctness, clarity, and reproducibility in the code
- Evaluating methods and rationale for any proposed analysis
- Ensuring that all necessary documentation is present and clear

## Overview of the review process

Below is a general overview of what you can expect during the code review process:

1. In most cases, the first time your PR is reviewed a Data Lab member will provide comments and suggestions.
Feel free to browse some [example reviewer comments](STUB_LINK to example review comments).

1. You will then need to respond to those comments.
Follow [these guidelines when addressing review comments](STUB_LINK to addressing review comments).

1. Once you have fully addressed comments from the reviewer, then you will be able to re-request a review.

The above steps will repeat until the reviewer feels that all comments have been addressed adequately.
At that time, the PR will be approved.
Bear in mind that it is _normal and expected_ for a pull request to undergo multiple rounds of review before it is approved.

## Approved pull requests

Once approved, the PR will be merged into the main branch of `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis` by a Data Lab team member.

!!! tip

    After your PR has been merged, be sure to [sync your fork with `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis`](../working-with-git/staying-in-sync-with-upstream.md) to ensure you are working with the most up to date code.
