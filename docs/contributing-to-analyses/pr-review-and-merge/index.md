# Code review and merging

> _More content coming soon!_

This section provides information about the code review process for [pull requests (PRs)](../creating-pull-requests/index.md) as well as the actions you should take after your PR is merged.

All PRs will undergo code review by a Data Lab member.
PRs must be approved before they can be merged into `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis` repository.
