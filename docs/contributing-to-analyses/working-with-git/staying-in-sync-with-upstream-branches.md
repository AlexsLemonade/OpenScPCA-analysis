# Staying in sync with upstream branches

## How to sync your fork with changes in AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis

1. Login to GitHub and navigate to the main page of your forked repository.

1. If the `main` branch of your fork is out of date with the `main` branch of `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis`, then you will see a note that states, "This branch is X commits behind `AlexsLemonade/Open-ScPca-analysis:main`".

    You can then press `Sync fork` to sync your fork with any upstream changes.

1. After pressing `Sync fork` a pop-up will notify you that the branch is out-of-date.
Go ahead and press `Update branch`.

1. If your `main` branch has been updated successfully, you will now see a note that the branch is up to date with `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis`.

If you do not see this and you see X, see how to resolve merge conflicts.
