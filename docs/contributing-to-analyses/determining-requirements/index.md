# Determining and Managing Requirements for Your Analysis

When performing an analysis, there are two sets of requirements to be aware of and plan for:

1. **Software requirements**, often called dependencies, refer to the collection of software languages, packages, or libraries required for your analysis to run.
Tracking and reporting dependencies is important so that others can run your code and reproduce your results.

    - See the [Software Requirements](./determining-software-requirements.md) page for approaches to track and manage dependencies.
