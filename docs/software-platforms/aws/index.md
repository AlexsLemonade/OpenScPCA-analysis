# Amazon Web Services

We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to grant contributors access to data and Linux virtual computers.

!!! note
    See [Getting Access to Resources](../../getting-started/accessing-resources/index.md) for more information about getting AWS access.

    Once we have created an AWS account for you, you can proceed to [set up your account](./joining-aws.md).



## S3: AWS for data

We use [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store project data in folders, referred to in S3 as "buckets."
Please refer to [our documentation on accessing project data](../../getting-started/accessing-resources/getting-access-to-data.md#accessing-data-on-s3) for more information.

We also use S3 as central location for you to share your result files with us before [filing a pull request](../../contributing-to-analyses/creating-pull-requests/index.md).
All contributors will have a designated [researcher bucket](working-with-s3-buckets.md) where results can be synced and shared as part of [code review](../../contributing-to-analyses/pr-review-and-merge/index.md).


## LSfR: AWS for virtual computing

We use an AWS product called ["Lightsail for Research" (LSfR)](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/research/) to provide virtual Linux (specifically, Ubuntu) computers.
