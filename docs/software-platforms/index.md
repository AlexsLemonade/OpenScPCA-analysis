# Software platforms

This section provides information about using some of OpenScPCA's core software platforms:

### [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](./aws/index.md)

- The OpenScPCA project uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud services, to both store data and provide contributors with a virtual computing environment.
    - We use [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store data and [Lightsail for Research (LSfR)](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/research/) for virtual computing.
- This section explains how to interact with data on S3 and how to use LSfR virtual computers.

### Docker

- The OpenScPCA project uses [Docker images](docker/index.md) to create reproducible analysis modules.
- For initial setup information, see the [Docker installation instructions](docker/index.md#how-to-install-docker).
- If you are creating your own Docker images for an analysis module, see our [Docker image guidelines](docker/docker-images.md).
