# Writing in markdown

You will often need to use markdown, a markup language to format your plain text.
With markdown, you can easily make text **bold**, _italicized_, and [add nicely-formatted links](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis) - to name a few handy features!

Files with the `.md` extension, such as the commonly-used `README.md` file, are written in markdown.
In particular, GitHub uses a "dialect" of markdown often called [GitHub-flavored markdown(GFM)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github).
You don't need to worry too much about GFM, but you may come across this term reading docs from GitHub!

You will generally use markdown when writing:

- GitHub Issues
- GitHub Discussions
- R Markdown and/or Jupyter notebooks
- Documentation in `README.md` files
