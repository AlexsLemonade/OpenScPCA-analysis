# General project tools

This section explains how you can use common tools you'll encounter in OpenScPCA, including:

- Writing in [markdown](./writing-in-markdown.md)
- Using the [terminal](./using-the-terminal.md) (also known as the command line)

Note that the [Working with Git](../../contributing-to-analyses/working-with-git/index.md) section provides information on using GitKraken.
