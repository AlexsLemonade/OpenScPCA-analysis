# Using the terminal

_WIP_

You'll need to use the terminal for things like:

- initial setup with conda
- installing precommit
- running the python script to create analysis modules
- running all code in a module
- and maybe more!


## What is the terminal?

- it's not the powershell
- we're specifically referring to shell which is likely to be either bash or zsh

!!! note "learn more terminal"

    You do not need to learn everything, but there are key intro commands that will help you, like `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`.

    here are some links...



## Different way to access the terminal

- open from utilities on mac, or search in spotlight
- WSL open from a place TBD
- Or GitKraken gives you a terminal which you can always use.
    - We like this option since, if you launch from the repo, you'll generally be in the right directory to run most commands
