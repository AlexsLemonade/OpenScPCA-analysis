# Explore existing analysis

Before contributing to OpenScPCA, you can explore and run any existing [analysis modules](../contributing-to-analyses/analysis-modules/index.md) on your local machine.

You can browse existing analysis modules in the repository in the [`analyses` folder](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/tree/main/analyses).
If you would like to be able to run the analysis modules on your own, follow the below steps.

## Set up local environment

Before you can run any analysis modules locally, you need to [set up your environment](../technical-setup/index.md).
This includes:

- [Choosing a Git client] and cloning the repository
- installing necessary tools such as conda

## Run existing modules

Each module will have it's own folder.
All instructions and files needed to run a given module will be contained in the module's folder.

To run existing modules, please reference the `README.md` found in the root directory for that module.

The `README.md` will contain a description of the module, instructions to run the module, the list of input and output files, and any additional software or computing resources you may need.

### Example modules

We have provided a set of example modules you can use.
There is one example module for working with R and one for working with Python.
