## Getting access to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

OpenScPCA contributors may be granted access to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

Before we create an AWS account for you, the following must be completed:

- You have agreed to the project [Terms of Use](../../policies/terms-of-use.md) and all other [Policies](../../policies/index.md) when you filled out [the project intake form](https://share.hsforms.com/1MlLtkGYSQa6j23HY_0fKaw336z0).
- You have filed a Discussion outlining the analysis you wish to perform and modify.

There are technical limits to the number of accounts we can create, so we want to be sure contributors will use them prior to allocation.
