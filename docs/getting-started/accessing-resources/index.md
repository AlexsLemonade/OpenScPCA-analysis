# Getting Access to Resources

We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to grant contributors access to data and Linux virtual computers.

## Getting access to AWS

Before we create an AWS account for you, the following must be completed:

- You have agreed to the project [Terms of Use](../../policies/terms-of-use.md) and all other [Policies](../../policies/index.md) when you filled out [the project intake form](https://share.hsforms.com/1MlLtkGYSQa6j23HY_0fKaw336z0).
- You have filed a Discussion outlining the analysis you wish to perform or modify.

There are technical limits to the number of accounts we can create, so we want to be sure contributors will use them prior to allocation.

See our documentation on [AWS](STUB_LINK) for more information.

## Getting access to data

See [Getting Access to Data](getting-access-to-data.md) for more information about downloading data.
Once an AWS account has been created for you, you can access data on S3 via the data download script in the repository.

## Getting access to compute

See [Getting Access to Compute](getting-access-to-compute.md) for more information about how we provide access to virtual computers.
