# Project tools

The OpenScPCA project supports UNIX-based platforms and is largely stuctured around the use of Git (and [GitHub](https://github.com)).
Therefore, as a contributor, there are several tools you will need to be familiar with, including:

- Git
  - [This documentation section](../../contributing-to-analyses/working-with-git/index.md) explains how to use Git as a contributor, specifically using the [GitKraken GUI](../../technical-setup/install-a-git-client.md#why-use-gitkraken)
- The [terminal](./using-the-terminal.md), also known as the command line
- Writing text in [markdown](./writing-in-markdown.md)
- Software management platforms, including [conda](#STUB_LINK conda software page) and, if you plan to develop R-based modules, [`renv`](#STUB_LINK renv software page)
