# Making your first analysis contribution

This is the path that you can expect to follow when making your first contribution to an analysis.

## Planning

### Make an analysis proposal 

Start with [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions) to propose a new analysis or a modification to an existing analysis.
You will file a discussion for:

* a new analysis in the [`Propose a new analysis` category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/categories/propose-a-new-analysis)
* an update to an existing analysis in the [`Modify an existing analysis` category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/categories/modify-an-existing-analysis)

A Data Lab team member will review your proposal and respond to your original post to discuss further.
Here you will continue to develop your analysis plans and make decisions about next steps.

**File an issue for the analysis**

* After you have proposed an analysis on discussions and a plan has been developed, then you can file an issue in the repository.
* The ideal issue will describe the scope and scientific goals of the analysis, the planned methods to address the scientific goals, and a proposed timeline for the analysis. 
[Read more about what makes a good issue](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/blob/main/docs/communications-tools/github-issues/what-makes-a-good-issue.md).

### Pick an existing issue 

* There may be existing issues in the repository for planned analyses that have not been started yet.
* If you would like to take on a planned analysis, you can comment on the issue to note your interest, ask any clarifying questions, and/or propose a solution for the Data Lab team to review and discuss further.
