# What makes a good issue?

Since issues [serve as the project's to-do list](index.md#what-are-github-issues-and-how-do-we-use-them), writing good, helpful issues is important.
We use [issue templates](./issue-templates.md) to support writing good issues, but we also list some features of good issues below to guide you in writing your best issues.

Good issues include the following:

- A title that is informative about the contents of the issue at a glance
- A relatively small and focused scope, such that [the pull request that closes them is appropriate in scope](../../contributing-to-analyses/creating-pull-requests/scoping-pull-requests.md)
- Ideas about how to accomplish a segment of work
- Enough context so that:
    - For someone other than the issue author to accomplish the work
    - [Pull request reviewers are set up for success](../../contributing-to-analyses/pr-review-and-merge/index.md)
- The requirements for satisfying or closing the issue (when known)
