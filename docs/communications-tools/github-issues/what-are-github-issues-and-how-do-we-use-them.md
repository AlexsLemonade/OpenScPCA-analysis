# What are GitHub Issues and how do we use them?

[GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) are a feature of GitHub that we use to track work associated with the project.
You can view all issues for the project here: <https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/issues>

Issues allow project maintainers and contributors to describe to one another how segments of work will be accomplished, and you can think of them as the to-do list associated with the project.
Issues can be labeled to help with organization, [assigned to people](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users) who will perform the work, and [searched and filtered](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#using-search-to-filter-issues-and-pull-requests).
You can link related issues together, [link issues to pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to add context, and [mention](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) Data Lab staff and other contributors using GitHub handles if an issue needs their attention.
Another key feature of issues is that they [can be closed](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/closing-an-issue) when a segment of work is completed.

For more information about issues, please see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues).

## When to use issues

Use issues to do the following:

* Report a bug
* Request additional documentation
* Track the initialization of an analysis module
* Track the modification of an analysis module
* Track updates to documentation

## Issue templates

We use issue templates to help guide project maintainers and contributors to write informative issues.
You can find more information in our [Issue Templates documentation](STUB_LINK).

## When to use Discussions instead

Sometimes, it will be more appropriate to file a GitHub Discussion instead of an issue.
Use discussions to do the following:

* Propose a new analysis
* Propose an update to a module that you did not originally author
* Get help troubleshooting (e.g., your local setup)
* Ask a question

When it comes to analyses, the main distinction between when to use a discussion vs. an issue is that discussions are for discussing work that _could be done_ and issues are for tracking work that _will be done_.
Similarly, a question from a contributor posted in discussions could lead to issues that track updates to documentation to address that question.
