# GitHub Issues

## What are GitHub Issues, and how do we use them?

[GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) are a GitHub feature that we use to track work associated with the project.

Issues allow project maintainers and contributors to describe to one another how segments of work will be accomplished.

You can think of them as the to-do list associated with the project.

When a segment of work is completed, we can _close_ an issue to mark it as done.

You can view all issues for the project here: <https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/issues>

## Writing issues

For more information about writing issues and using issue templates, see our documentation on [Writing GitHub Issues](writing-issues.md).

## When to use issues

You will typically file an issue after having a discussion on GitHub Discussions (see: [How and When to Use Discussions](../index.md#how-and-when-to-use-discussions)).

The main distinction between when to use a discussion vs. an issue is that discussions are for discussing work that _could be done_ and issues are for tracking work that _will be done_.

Use issues to do the following:

* Report a bug
* Request additional documentation
* Track creating an analysis module
* Track modifying an analysis module
* Track modifying documentation

## When not to use issues

Here are some examples of when not to use issues:

* To propose a new analysis or a modification to an existing analysis ([File a discussion instead](../index.md#propose-a-new-analysis-or-a-modification-to-an-existing-analysis))
* To report a security vulnerability ([Report it via email instead](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/blob/main/SECURITY.md))
* To get help troubleshooting your local setup ([File a discussion instead](../index.md#ask-questions))

See the [Tools for Communication documentation](../index.md) for a full discussion of how we use different communication tools within the project.
