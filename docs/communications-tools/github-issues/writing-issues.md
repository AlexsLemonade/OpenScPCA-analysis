# Writing GitHub issues

## Creating a new issue

To create a new issue, follow these instructions from GitHub: <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository>

You will be prompted with a selection of issues from our issue templates.
See our documentation on [OpenScPCA Issue Templates](issue-templates.md) for more about how to use the templates.

## Markdown

[GitHub Issues are written in Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github), a plain text language for formatting documents.
See our documentation on [Markdown](STUB_LINK markdown section under software tools) for more information about writing in Markdown.

GitHub supports [a "dialect" of Markdown called GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
You don't need to worry too much about GFM, but you may come across this term reading docs from GitHub!

## Using mentions

Sometimes, you may need a Data Lab team member or another contributor to take a look at your issue!
You can use mentions to direct people's attention to your issue or a comment.

To mention someone, use `@{GitHub handle}`, replacing everything after `@` (including the curly brackets `{}`) with the person's GitHub handle; there is no need to use backticks around the mention.

You can find more information about mentioning people in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams).

## Referencing related issues and pull requests

It can be helpful to refer to related issues or pull requests when you are writing an issue to provide extra context for others and help keep the project organized.

Use the number of the GitHub issue or pull request, preceded by a number sign (`#`), to reference it.
For example, to reference <https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/issues/243>, you would write #243 in the body of the issue.

You can read more about referencing issues and pull requests, included advanced usage, in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests).

## Labels

You can use issue labels to help you filter existing issues.
See [GitHub's documentation on filtering issues and pull requests by labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#filtering-issues-and-pull-requests-by-labels) for more information

!!! note "Applying labels"
    You will not have permissions to apply labels to issues yourself.
    Please mention a Data Lab team member to ask for a label to be applied to an issue you've created.
