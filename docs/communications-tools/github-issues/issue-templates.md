# Issue Templates

We use issue templates to prompt issue authors to include information that helps us accomplish the work tracked in that issue.
Put another way, we have created templates that help us write [good issues](what-makes-a-good-issue.md).

## Selecting a template

When you create a new issue, you will be prompted to select what kind of issue you would like to file.

    <figure markdown="span">
      ![new issue template selection](../../img/new-issue-template-selection.png){width="600"}
    </figure>

The first five entries accompanied with a green `Getting Started` button are the issue templates.
Below, we describe what the options are and how we use them in the project.

### Create a release

!!! note

    We don't expect contributors that are not Data Lab staff to use this issue template.

Use this issue template to track creating a semantically-versioned release associated with a project milestone.

### Opening a blank issue

If none of these templates are relevant to the issue you would like to file, scroll all the way down and select Open a blank issue.
Remember to follow [the principles of good issues](what-makes-a-good-issue.md)!
