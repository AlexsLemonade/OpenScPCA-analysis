# Tools for communication

OpenScPCA community members will use the following tools for communication and collaboration. Learn more about using:

* [GitHub Discussions](#github-discussions)
* [GitHub Issues](#github-issues)
* [Slack](#slack)

## GitHub Discussions

[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart) is the community forum for the project, [which can be found here](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions) in the `OpenScPCA-Analysis` repository.
You are most likely to engage with the project for the first time via Discussions.

⚠️Please read this [pinned discussion](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/111) from the Data Lab before creating your first post!

### How and When to Use Discussions

Discussions are organized by category.
Please [read the description of each category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/new/choose) to make sure you are posting in the correct place. 
More on categories below!

**Participate in community conversations.** 

* Discuss big picture ideas, brainstorm, and develop plans for analyses before implementing them.

**Propose a new analysis.** 

* Propose a new analysis in the [`Analysis Ideas` category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/categories/analysis-ideas), before committing it to an issue. 
* Create a post to explain why you are proposing an analysis and an overview of your planned methods. 
* Project maintainers will ask clarifying questions, raise any concerns, and come to a decision about proceeding.

**Ask questions.**

* Get help from project maintainers and/or community members. 
* Use the [`Q&A` category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/categories/q-a) to ask non-urgent questions. For example, where to find information.
* Use the [`Troubleshooting` category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/categories/troubleshooting) to get help from project maintainers. For example, challenges with setting up your local environment or trouble running an analysis.

**View announcements related to the project.** 

* We will post in the [`Announcements` category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/categories/announcements) when there is news that the community should know about. For example, if the Data Lab staff will be offline for a few days.

**Provide feedback about the project.**

* We may ask the community for feedback in the [`Polls` category](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/discussions/categories/polls).

## GitHub Issues

[GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) are used to plan, define, and track pieces of work.
They also help us prioritize, schedule tasks, and identify blockers.

Issues should be focused and manageable in scope. 
Smaller chunks of work are easier to accomplish and review!
An issue will eventually be linked to a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
We always aim for a ratio of one issue to one pull request.

**Please read the Data Lab's documentation on:**

* How we use GitHub issues 
* Writing good issues 
  
⚠️ Please engage with project maintainers via Discussions, email, or Slack before filing your first issue in the `OpenScPCA-Analysis` repository. 
We will provide you with further guidance!

### How and When to Use Issues

**File an issue for a proposed analysis that has been accepted.** 

* *After* you have proposed an analysis on the discussions forum and it has been accepted by project maintainers, then you can file an issue.
* The ideal issue will describe the scope and scientific goals of the analysis, the planned methods to address the scientific goals, and a proposed timeline for the analysis. 

**Identify a planned analysis that you wish to tackle.** 

* There are existing issues for planned analyses that others may not be working on yet. 
* If you would like to take on a planned analysis, you can comment on the issue to note your interest and ask any clarifying questions. Propose a solution for project maintainers to review and discuss further.

**Report a bug.**

* If you encounter a bug, please file an issue using the `Bug Report` issue template to help us make improvements! 
* Provide a clear and detailed description of the problem.
* Include any relevant error messages or reports.

## Slack

### #open-scpca Slack channel

As part of onboarding, we will add you to the `#open-scpca` channel in our [Cancer Data Science Slack](https://cancer-data-science.slack.com/). 
After joining, please feel free to send a message to  introduce yourself to the community!

### When to Use the Slack Channel

We encourage you to ask questions on Slack, so they are visible to the entire OpenScPCA community. 
For example, post questions on the channel about:

* an error you encountered while getting set up 
* an analysis you are working on
* the data and tools you are using as part of this project

If you have a question, it's likely that someone else has a similar one! 
Posting on Slack makes it possible for any project maintainer or community member to help you.
We cannot always respond immediately, but we will do our best to answer to all messages within 24 hours. 

**Helpful tips:**

* Please try to use threads for responses to questions or ongoing conversations about the same topic.
* Slack messages are not permanent and will disappear after 30 days. If there is a post that contains information you want to refer back to, we recommend that you save it elsewhere. 

### Direct messages

If you need to address a private matter or have a question that is highly specific to you, you may direct message a Data Lab staff member.
In all other cases, please use the `#open-scpca` Slack channel to reach us.

Direct messages can be sent to `Jen O'Malley`, `Jaclyn Taroni`, `Ally Hawkins`, `Josh Shapiro`, or `Stephanie Spielman`.

We may direct you back to the `#open-scpca` channel or to another staff member when appropriate.

In some cases, you may use Slack to report a concern to a Data Lab staff member.
See the [reporting section of the Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-admin/blob/main/code-of-conduct/code-of-conduct.md#report-an-incident) to learn more about when to use Slack for reporting.
