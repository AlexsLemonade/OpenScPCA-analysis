# Managing dependencies with conda

We strongly recommend using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and [`conda-lock`](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/) to manage dependencies for any module written primarily in Python, as well as for standalone software packages that do not depend on a specific language.
Many useful bioinformatics tools are available through [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), which should already be configured as a conda channel.
These instructions assume you have already [installed conda and set up your base environment](../../technical-setup/environment-setup/setup-conda.md).

## Conda and `conda-lock`

Conda is a powerful package manager, but it has some limitations when trying to perfectly reproduce an environment across different computer platforms (e.g., between Linux and macOS).
In particular, some packages have dependencies that vary depending on the platform that is being used, which makes tracking dependencies across platforms difficult with the built-in conda tools.
To address this, we use [`conda-lock`](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/), which provides the following advantages:

- The `conda-lock.yml` files created by `conda-lock` capture exact versions of all software packages in the environment, including both packages listed in the `environment.yml` file and all of their dependencies.
- Dependencies required for each platform are discovered and recorded separately by `conda-lock`, ensuring that the environment can be recreated on every platform where the software is available.
- This means that we can leave the `environment.yml` file as a "high-level" list of required software which is easy to read and update, while also having a "low-level" lockfile that contributors can use to recreate the environment exactly.


## Initializing a module-specific conda environment

When [creating a Python module using `create-analysis-module.py`](../../contributing-to-analyses/analysis-modules/creating-a-module.md#flags-to-create-a-python-module), a conda environment will be created for that module by default with two effects:

* A basic `environment.yml` file will already be present in the module's directory
* A conda environment named `openscpca-{module_name}` will already exist

You can activate the environment by running the following command:

```bash
conda activate openscpca-{module_name}
```

If you are working on an existing module for the first time and an `environment.yml` file is present, you can create and activate a new environment for the module by running the following command from the module's root directory, replacing `{module_name}` with the name of the module you are working on:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml --name openscpca-{module_name}
conda activate openscpca-{module_name}
```

??? info "Adding an `environment.yml` file to an existing module"

    If you are working on an existing module that does not yet have an `environment.yml` file, it is usually best to start from the template that we have provided.
    This template can be found at [`templates/python/environment.yml`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/blob/main/templates/python/environment.yml) in the OpenScPCA-analysis repository.

    Copy this file to the root directory of the module, then replace `{{ openscpca_module }}` (including the braces) in the `name:` field  with the name of the module.

    You can then follow the instructions above to create the environment and begin installing your required software packages.


## Creating and updating `conda-lock.yml` files

To create a `conda-lock.yml` file from an `environment.yml` file, run the following command from the module directory:

```bash
conda-lock --file environment.yml
```

This will create or update a `conda-lock.yml` file in the module directory that contains the exact versions of all software packages in the environment, including any dependencies that may be specific to a given platform.

You should perform this step before [filing a pull request](../../contributing-to-analyses/creating-pull-requests/index.md) to ensure that the `conda-lock.yml` file is up-to-date with the current state of your environment.

!!! note
    If the `conda-lock` command fails, it may be because a package is not available for one of the platforms listed in the `environment.yml` file.
    Usually this will be a package that is not available for the `osx-arm64` (Apple silicon) platform.

    If this happens, see the [Software not available on a specific platform](#adding-dependencies-not-available-on-a-specific-platform) section below for instructions on how to handle this situation.

## Adding packages to the environment

If there is additional software you intend to use or discover is required for a module, you can add it with the `conda install` command when the environment is activated.
Following installation, update the `environment.yml` file with that package and the dependencies that were installed.

For example, to install the `pandas` package and record it in the `environment.yml` file, you would run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the module's root directory
cd analyses/{module_name}
# Activate that module's environment
conda activate openscpca-{module_name}
# Install the package
conda install pandas
```

You should then immediately add the newly installed package to the module's `environment.yml` file.

To do this, first check which version was installed, which you can find by either:

- Looking at the output from the previous `conda install` command, or
- Running a command like the following, which will print out the version number of the package in your current environment:

    ```bash
    conda list pandas
    ```

Then add the package to the `dependencies:` section of the `environment.yml` file with a version number, as shown below:

<div class="grid" markdown>

``` { .yaml .no-copy title="Before"}
dependencies:
  - python=3.11
  - awscli=2.15
  - conda-lock=2.5
  - jq=1.7
  - pre-commit=3.6
  - session-info=1.0
```

``` { .yaml .no-copy title="After"}
dependencies:
  - python=3.11
  - awscli=2.15
  - conda-lock=2.5
  - jq=1.7
  - pre-commit=3.6
  - session-info=1.0
  - pandas=2.2.1
```

</div>

After you have finished updating the `environment.yml` file, you should rerun `conda-lock` to update the `conda-lock.yml` file with the new package(s) and their dependencies.


### Finding available packages and software

To find software available through conda, you can search the conda repositories with the following command:

```bash
conda search {package_name}
```

Alternatively, you can search [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org) for packages and channels.


### Adding dependencies not available on a specific platform

While most conda packages are available for all platforms, there may be some cases where a particular platform does not have a version of a package.

Most often this will occur for ARM-based computers, such as macOS computers with Apple silicon M-series processors.
If you encounter an error with `conda-lock --file environment.yml`, it may be because a package is not available for the `osx-arm64` platform.

In this case, you should edit the `environment.yml` file to *remove* the `- osx-arm64` line from the `platforms:` section.
Then you will want to rerun `conda-lock`, but this time creating platform-specific lockfiles:

```bash
conda-lock --file environment.yml --kind explicit
```

This will result in separate files for each supported platform with names like `conda-linux-64.lock` or `conda-osx-64.lock`.

You can then use `conda-lock` to install or update your environment from the lockfile specific to the platform that you are using.
For example, to install and activate and environment from the `conda-linux-64.lock` file, you would run the following commands:

```bash
conda-lock install --name openscpca-{module_name} conda-linux-64.lock
conda activate openscpca-{module_name}
```

If you are using an Apple silicon computer, you will need to use the `conda-osx-64.lock` file, with one extra option to allow installation of the non-native platform lockfile, and one extra command to ensure that any future software you install in the environment will use the same architecture:

```bash
conda-lock install --no-validate-platform --name openscpca-{module_name} conda-osx-64.lock
conda activate openscpca-{module_name}
conda config --env --set subdir osx-64
```

!!! tip "Adding packages that are not available for your current platform"
    If you find you need to add a package to an existing environment that is not available for your _current_ platform (i.e., a package that is only available for Intel on an Apple silicon computer), the easiest method is to follow a slightly different order of operations:

    - First, add the package name and version to the `environment.yml` file.
    - Next, remove the `osx-arm64` line from the `platforms:` section of the `environment.yml` file.
    - Then, run `conda-lock --file environment.yml --kind explicit` to create the platform specific lockfiles.
    - Finally, use the `conda-lock install --no-validate-platform` command above to update your environment using the newly-created lockfile.


## Activating existing environments in a module

If you are working with an existing analysis module, it should have a `conda-lock.yml` file present in the module directory.
You can create and activate the environment on the computer you are using by running the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the module's root directory
cd analyses/{module_name}/
conda-lock install --name openscpca-{module_name} conda-lock.yml
conda activate openscpca-{module_name}
```

If the `conda-lock.yml` file has been updated since the last time you worked with the repository, you should rerun the `conda-lock install` command to update your environment to the latest version.

Occasionally you may encounter a Python-based module that does not yet have a `conda-lock.yml` file.
This is most likely to occur early in development of a module when the requirements may still be in flux.
(If you do find a module that is missing a `conda-lock.yml` file, you may want to [file an issue](../../communications-tools/github-issues/index.md) to let us know.)
As long as there is an `environment.yml` file, you can still create an environment to work with the module.
To do so, run the following commands from the module's root directory, replacing `{module_name}` with the name of the module you are working on:

```bash
# Navigate to the module's root directory
cd analyses/{module_name}/
conda env create --name openscpca-{module_name} --file environment.yml
conda activate openscpca-{module_name}
```

!!! note
    During the `conda env create` step, you may see the following warning:

    ```{.console .no-copy}
    EnvironmentSectionNotValid: The following section on 'environment.yml' is invalid and will be ignored:
     - platforms
    ```

    This warning can be safely ignored; proceed with the installation and activate the environment.
