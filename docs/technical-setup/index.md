# Technical setup

This section provides instructions for technical aspects of set up, including:

- Downloading and setting up a [Git client](./install-a-git-client.md)
- [Forking the `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis` repository](./fork-the-repo.md)
- [Cloning your fork](./clone-the-repo.md) to your computer
- Setting up [additional dependencies](environment-setup/index.md) on your computer that you'll need to contribute to OpenScPCA

!!! warning
    At this time, the OpenScPCA project only supports macOS and Linux operating systems.
    Instructions are therefore geared towards using these platforms.

    If you would like to see Windows supported, please [let us know by filing an issue](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/issues/new?assignees=&labels=docs-request&projects=&template=04-docs-request.yml&title=Docs+request%3A)!

    Note that all contributors have access to [Lightsail for Research](STUB_LINK LSfR) instances which run Linux (Ubuntu).
