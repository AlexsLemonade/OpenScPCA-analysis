# Install a GitHub client

You will need a platform on your computer to run Git commands and interact with <GitHub.com>.

There are many platforms you can choose, but we recommend using either [**GitKraken**](https://www.gitkraken.com/) or the [Git **command line interface**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line):

### Why use GitKraken?

> This option is best for contributors who are new to Git.

GitKraken is a GUI (graphical-user interface) which lets you "point-and-click" to run all Git commands.
GitKraken is a more user-friendly option which does not require you to use the command line (aka, terminal) or memorize Git commands.
GitKraken is also free to use with public repositories like `OpenScPCA-analysis`; you do not need to upgrade to a paid plan.

[Follow this link](https://www.gitkraken.com/download) to install GitKraken.
When setting up GitKraken, we recommend directly signing in with your GitHub account.
This will automatically provide you with the credentials you need to interact with <GitHub.com> without further setup.

### Why use the Git command line interface?

> This option is best for contributors who have previous Git experience.

The UNIX command-line interface is the classic way of running Git commands.
We specifically recommend this option for contributors who have previous experience working with Git on the command line.
If you are new to Git, we do not recommend this option.

MacOS systems provide native access to the command line with the `Terminal` app.
Windows systems will need to install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to access aa UNIX command line.
