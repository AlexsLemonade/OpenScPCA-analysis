# Environment setup

This section of the documentation walks you through additional setup steps that will allow you to contribute to OpenScPCA.

This section assumes that you have already taken the following setup steps:

- Downloaded your [Git client of interest](../install-a-github-client.md)
    - If you are working on a Windows machine, you will also have needed to install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](STUB_LINK wsl instructions).
- [Forked the `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis` repository](../fork-the-repo.md)
- [Cloned your fork](../clone-the-repo.md) to your computer


Next, you'll have to download and setup a few additional items to get started contributing:

- All contributors should [download and set up conda](./setup-conda.md)
    - This will also provide you with Python and other tools you need to contribute to Python-based modules
- All contributors should [set up `pre-commit`](./setup-precommit.md)
- If you plan on contributing R-based modules, you should also [set up R, RStudio, and install a few handy R packages](./install-r-rstudio.md)
