# Environment setup

This section of the documentation walks you through additional setup steps that will allow you to contribute to OpenScPCA.

This section assumes that you have already taken these setup steps:

- Downloaded your [Git client of interest](../install-a-github-client.md)
    - If you are working on a Windows machine, you first need to install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](STUB_LINK WSL instructions) before setting up Git.
- [Forked the `AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis` repository](../fork-the-repo.md)
- [Cloned your fork](../clone-the-repo.md) to your computer

## Setting up locally

If you are getting set up to work on your computer, you will need to take these additional steps:

- [Download and set up conda](./setup-conda.md)
    - This will also provide you with Python and other tools you need to write or contribute to Python-based modules
- [Set up `pre-commit`](./setup-precommit.md)
- [Optional] If you plan on writing or contributing to R-based modules, you should also [set up R, RStudio, and install a few handy R packages](./install-r-rstudio.md)

## Setting up on Lightsail for Research

If you are getting set up to work on a Lightsail for Research instance, please refer to the [Lightsail for Research documentation](STUB_LINK for LSfR).
