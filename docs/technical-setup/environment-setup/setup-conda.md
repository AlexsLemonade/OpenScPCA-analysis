# Install and set up conda

## What is conda?

The OpenScPCA project uses [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage your software environment.
Conda is a command-line software management tool which helps you install and track specific versions of software.
It also allows you to have multiple software environments with different sets of packages on the same computer.

This page provides instructions on how to install conda and use it to install certain software you will need to contribute to OpenScPCA.


### Why use conda?

There are two main reasons we use conda for OpenScPCA:

- conda provides a "one stop shop" for installing lots of different software
    - Rather than having to figure out how to install every new program and its dependencies, conda can handle it all for you.
    - You'll use conda to install the software dependencies you'll need to contribute to OpenScPCA.
- conda allows you set up different software environments for different projects
    - For example, you may have two projects that require different versions of the same package.
    With conda, you can create separate, fully isolated software environments for each project with different package versions.
    - Python-based OpenScPCA analysis modules as well as those that require other external software will use different conda environments to prevent conflicts and improve reproducibility.
    Therefore, installing conda is also part of setting up your computer to be able to contribute to Python-based modules.


## Install conda

We recommend installing [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#miniforge) to obtain conda.
Miniforge is lightweight version of the conda distribution that is free and open source.
The installation includes the conda tool itself, Python, and a few other commonly-used packages.

If you already have conda on your system, you do not need to re-install it.


### Installing conda with Miniforge

To install Miniforge, follow the [installation instructions in the Miniforge repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install).

Briefly, you will need to open a terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

!!! note
    On Windows with WSL 2, you will need to install Miniforge on the WSL 2 side of your system, starting from the [Ubuntu terminal](../../getting-started/project-tools/using-the-terminal.md).

* You will be prompted first to view the license; press enter as instructed, read the license (you should be able to scroll with your arrow keys), then press `q` to return to the installer.
* Accept the license by typing `yes`, and then continue following the prompts to complete the installation.
* You will be asked about the installation location (you can press `enter` to accept the default, which should be fine).
* Finally, you will be asked whether you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda.
We recommend selecting `yes`.

When the installation is complete, you will see the following message:

```{ .console .no-copy title="Output message after miniforge install"}
==> For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell. <==

Thank you for installing Miniforge3!
```

## Set up conda

Next, you will need to set certain conda settings and install a few packages that will allow you to contribute to OpenScPCA in general.

1. [Open a new terminal (command line prompt)](../../getting-started/project-tools/using-the-terminal.md) to interact with conda.

1. Copy and paste the following code into the terminal, and hit enter.
These commands will set the [recommended channels](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/channels.html) conda should use to search for software.
    - If you get the error `conda: command not found`, you may need to try again in a new terminal window.
    If this still doesn't work, [you can always ask us for help](../../troubleshooting-faq/index.md).

    ```sh
    conda config --add channels bioconda
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    ```

    ??? info "What are these channels?"
        - The `bioconda` channel is a community-maintained repository of bioinformatics software.
        - The `conda-forge` channel is a community-maintained repository of conda packages.
        - The `channel_priority strict` setting ensures that conda will search for packages in the order you specify the channels.
        This is important for ensuring that you get the correct versions of packages when you install them.

        Note that we do not include the `defaults` channel in the list of channels, as this is managed by Anaconda Inc., which may require license fees for its use.


### Create an `openscpca` conda environment

The last step is to create an `openscpca` conda environment and install the packages needed for OpenScPCA development.
These are specified in the `environment.yml` in the root of the repository, and include:

- The [`awscli` package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) will allow you to interact with [data stored in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket](../../aws/index.md#s3-data-and-results-storage-with-aws)
- The [`conda-lock` package](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/) is used to create fully reproducible, cross-platform [conda environments for analysis modules](../../ensuring-repro/managing-software/using-conda.md#conda-and-conda-lock)
- The [`jq` package](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) provides JSON parsing capabilities
- The [`pre-commit` package](https://pre-commit.com) will allow you to use [pre-commit hooks when contributing to analysis modules](../../contributing-to-analyses/working-with-git/making-commits.md#pre-commit-checks)

<!-- Comment to force above to be bullets, next to be numbers -->


1. To create this environment, navigate in the terminal with `cd` to the `OpenScPCA-analysis` repository.

2. Enter the following command in the terminal to create the `openscpca` environment and install the packages into it:

    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

    You will see a number of status messages flow by as packages are downloaded and installed.
    When the process is complete, you'll see the following message in the terminal, which includes the commands to activate and deactivate the environment:

    ```{ .console .no-copy title="Output message after conda environment install"}
    Preparing transaction: done
    Verifying transaction: done
    Executing transaction: done
    # To activate this environment, use
    #
    #     $ conda activate openscpca
    #
    # To deactivate an active environment, use
    #
    #     $ conda deactivate
    ```

    ??? info "Prefer to modify your base environment instead?"
        While we recommended creating an `openscpca` environment, this is not strictly necessary.
        If you prefer to add these packages to your base environment, use this command instead:
        ```sh
        conda env update -n base -f environment.yml
        ```
        If you experience package conflicts when running this command, we recommend you go back to setting up a dedicated `openscpca` environment.



1. As indicated in the message, activate the environment with the following command:

    ```sh
    conda activate openscpca
    ```

    At this point, your terminal prompt will show the prefix `(openscpca)`, which lets you know that you are in that conda environment.
    In general, this is how conda indicates which environment, if any, the terminal is working in.

    !!! tip "Activating the `openscpca` conda environment"
        Whenever you are developing for OpenScPCA, you should work from either the `openscpa` conda environment or [a module-specific conda environment](../../ensuring-repro/managing-software/using-conda.md).
        At the start of any coding session, run `conda activate openscpca` to activate this environment.
        If you wish to deactivate the environment, you can run `conda deactivate`.
