# Install and setup `conda`

The `OpenScPCA` project uses [`conda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) to setup your base software environment.
`conda` is a _software management_ tool which helps you install specific versions of software in many programming languages.
We also use `conda` to handle [software dependencies for Python-based analysis modules](STUB_LINK).
This page provides instructions on how to install `conda` and use it to install certain software you will need to contribute to `OpenScPCA`.

To begin, [install Miniconda for your operating system](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).
Miniconda is lightweight version of the full `conda` platform and includes the `conda` tool itself, Python, and a few other commonly-used packages.


To setup `conda` after installation, follow the instructions based on your operating system:

### Setup `conda` on MacOS

1. You can use `conda` via the `Terminal` application.
To launch `Terminal`, search for "terminal" in spotlight and open the application.



1. Copy and paste the following code into `Terminal`, and hit enter.

    !!! info
        If you get an error `conda: command not found`, this means `conda` was not properly installed.

    This option is best for contributors who have previous experience with Git and the command line.

    If you are new to Git, we do not recommend this option.
