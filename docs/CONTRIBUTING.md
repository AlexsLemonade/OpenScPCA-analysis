_This not the `OpenScPCA-analysis` project documentation._
_Please refer to [this site](PENDING) for documentation about contributing to the `OpenScPCA-analysis` project._


## Developing the docs

`OpenScPCA-analysis` documentation is written in markdown with [`Material for MkDocs`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
The [`mkdocs.yml`](../mkdocs.yml) is the documentation configuration file, and documentation pages are stored in the `docs` directory.
To locally test documentation, you will need `python3` and dependencies listed in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file.

To serve the documentation, run `mkdocs serve` from the root directory of this repository.
