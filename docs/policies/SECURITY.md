# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To notify us about a security issue or flaw, please email a description of the issue, as well as any steps for mitigation (if known), to <report@ccdatalab.org>.

**Please do not file an issue, start a GitHub Discussion, file a pull request, or post in any other public forum (e.g., Cancer Data Science Slack) to report a security issue.**

We will do our best to investigate and fix the problem quickly.
