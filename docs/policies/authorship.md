# Authorship Policy

## OpenScPCA authorship criteria

Authorship criteria for any future OpenScPCA publication(s) will follow [guidance from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME)](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html).

In particular, the following [four criteria recommended by ICJME](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html#two) must be met:

> - Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
> - Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content; AND
> - Final approval of the version to be published; AND
> - Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

We expect contributors to participate in the conception and design of the work through Discussions, issues, and review, and to contribute analyses and interpretation by filing pull requests to the `OpenScPCA-analysis` repository.
To meet the criteria for authorship, these contributions must lead to a portion of results included in a publication.

OpenScPCA contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship may still be acknowledged with their permission.

We encourage you to review [the ICJME guidance](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) in full.

## Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)

Any OpenScPCA publication will use the [Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)](https://credit.niso.org/) to describe each author's contribution to the work.
You can view the definitions of roles here: <https://credit.niso.org/contributor-roles-defined/>.
