# Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Open Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas Project, which is
supported by Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation ("**we**," "**our**," or
"**us**").

Your access to, and use of, the OpenScPCA Project is subject to our
Terms of Use, located at <https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/blob/main/docs/policies/terms-of-use.md> (the **"Terms of
Use"**). We have created this Privacy Policy (this **"Privacy
Policy"**) to explain what information we gather when you visit or
interact with the OpenScPCA Project, how we and others may use your
information, and the security approaches we use to protect your
information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made part of
the Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy
Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.

By using the OpenScPCA Project, you consent to the collection and use of
your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we decide to
change this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated version on this
page. Changes to this Privacy Policy will apply only to information
collected after the date of the change.

1. **What information is gathered?**

We may collect and retain information from or about you when you register on the OpenScPCA Project, seek authentication, send or respond to communications, or participate in another OpenScPCA Project feature. Here are the types of personal information we gather:

-   **Information You Give Us:** When registering or seeking
    authentication, or otherwise communicating with us, we may ask you
    for your name, email address, mailing address, phone number,
    credentials or other similar information.

-   **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of
    information whenever you interact with us, including IP addresses
    and session identifiers. We collect and store information regarding
    your use of applications, virtual computing machines, or other
    infrastructure, data, or other content we provide or manage in
    connection with the OpenScPCA Project. We may use
    "cookies" or other tracking tools to enhance your experience and
    gather information about Users and visits to the OpenScPCA Project.
    Please refer to the "May we use 'cookies' or other tracking
    tools?\" section below for information about cookies and how we may
    use them.

-   **Information from Other Sources:** For purposes such as
    authentication, monitoring, completeness or accuracy, we may receive
    information about you from other sources, including third parties
    you have authorized to share information with us, and we may add or
    relate such information to your account.

2\.  **How do we respond to "Do Not Track" signals?**

Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based "Do Not Track" (**"DNT"**) signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to, or provide Users with a different OpenScPCA Project experience based on, undefined "DNT" signals to the OpenScPCA Project.

3\.  **How do we use your personal information?**

We may use your personal information in any of the following ways:

-   To authenticate or update your information.

-   To administer your account or profile.

-   To respond to your support requests or otherwise communicate with
    you.

-   To provide or facilitate any services or transactions associated
    with your account.

-   To personalize and optimize your OpenScPCA Project experience and to
    learn about your preferences.

-   To monitor your compliance with the Terms of Use and all applicable
    Policies.

-   To prevent or remedy any unauthorized or disruptive activity.

-   To administer a survey or other OpenScPCA Project feature.

-   To operate, maintain, analyze, improve, control, or customize the
    OpenScPCA Project.

4\.  **Do we disclose the information we collect?**

  We generally do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personal
information to outside parties unless we provide you with advance
notice. However, we may disclose personal information as described
below:

-   **Agents and Contractors:** We may contract with other companies and
    individuals to operate the OpenScPCA Project and to perform
    functions on our behalf. Examples include maintaining and hosting
    the OpenScPCA Project, analyzing data, and providing support. Our
    agents and contractors have access to personal information needed to
    perform their functions, but they must reasonably safeguard such
    information and they may not use it or disclose it for other
    purposes.

-   **Authentication:** We may disclose your personal information to
    third parties as reasonably necessary to authenticate you and your
    information, as applicable.

-   **Business Transfers:** In the event that we sell or otherwise
    transfer our assets, or reorganize, merge or transfer our entity, we
    may provide your information to the purchaser to enable continued
    use of the OpenScPCA Project. We will take reasonable steps to seek
    similar treatment of your information, but the purchaser might
    operate under a different privacy policy.

-   **Protection of Us and Others:** We release personal information
    when we believe it is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or
    apply the Terms of Use or our other applicable Policies or
    agreements; or protect the rights, privacy, property, or safety of
    us, Users or others. We may share information regarding unauthorized
    or suspicious activity with affected Users, an independent
    Institutional Review Board or other ethics board, or institutional
    authorities, as applicable.

    Subject to applicable law, we may share aggregated and statistical
    information with third parties.

5\.  **How is personal information corrected or updated?**

  You can correct or update your personal information by re-registering,
  updating your profile, or by contacting us at report@ccdatalab.org.
  You can also request that we delete your personal information or
  remove you from our communications.

6\.  **May we use "cookies" or other tracking tools?**

Yes. We may use web tracking tools such as cookies and web beacons. A
cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard
drive when you visit those pages, but the only personal information a
cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. We may use
cookies to track User traffic patterns when you click on various links
throughout the OpenScPCA Project to help us understand your
preferences and to offer better experiences and tools on the OpenScPCA
Project.

We may contract with third party service providers to assist us in
better understanding our Users, including tracking User clicks and
recording anonymized User sessions. These service providers are not
permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to
help us conduct and improve the OpenScPCA Project.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is
being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies, through your
browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your
browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If
you turn cookies off, you might not be able to access or use certain
OpenScPCA Project services, features or functionality.

7\.  **How secure is personal information?**

We follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard
and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
properly use your personal information. However, no commercial method
of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage
is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the
absolute security of that information during its transmission or its
storage in our systems.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
password, API keys and other identifying tokens, and to your computer.
Be sure to sign off when you are finished using the OpenScPCA Project.

8\.  **European Data Privacy Rights**

In certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to obtain
confirmation as to whether your personal information is being
processed, information about the purposes of that processing, and
information about the recipients to whom your personal data have been
or will be disclosed. You may also have the right to receive a copy of
the personal data you have provided and/or request its deletion. To
exercise these rights, please contact us using the information
detailed in the Questions and Feedback section below.

We are transparent about the ways in which we collect and use personal
information, and we welcome your questions and concerns. If you have
any concern or complaint about the way we handle your personal
information, please contact us as described below. To the extent you
believe we have not addressed your concerns or otherwise choose to do
so, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
authority in the country where you reside and/or in the United States.
For information on how you can file a privacy complaint with the
Federal Trade Commission, please visit:

9\.  **Important Notices to Non-United States Residents**

It is important to note that the OpenScPCA Project is operated in the
United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please
be aware that any personal information you provide to us will be
transferred to the United States. By using the OpenScPCA Project
and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to
this transfer.

10\. **Third Party Links**

In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include
third party links on the OpenScPCA Project. These linked sites have
separate and independent privacy policies, which we encourage you to
review. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the
content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to
protect the integrity of the OpenScPCA Project and welcome any
feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does
not work).

11\. **Children\'s Privacy**

We do not knowingly intend to collect personal information from
children under 13 years of age. If a child has provided us with
personal information, a parent or guardian of that child may send an
email message to <report@ccdatalab.org> with \"Request for Child
Information Removal\" in the subject line and the name and age of the
child in the body of the message. After confirmation, we will make
reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from the database
that stores information for the OpenScPCA Project.

12\. **Questions and Feedback**

Any questions or feedback about the OpenScPCA Project or this Privacy
Policy should be directed to <ccdl@alexslemonade.org>.
