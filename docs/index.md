# Welcome to OpenScPCA

OpenScPCA is an open, collaborative project to analyze data from the [Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA) Portal](https://scpca.alexslemonade.org/), which currently holds 500 samples from over 50 pediatric cancer types.

This project aims to:

- Characterize the ScPCA data with analyses such as labeling cell types or identifying recurrent cell states in multiple tumor types

- Work on open and collaborative analyses.

- Build consensus around usage, strengths, and pitfalls of methods and their application to pediatric cancer data.

- Improve the utility of the ScPCA data for the research community by exploring the creation of new data assets (e.g., integrated objects).


## How it works

<div class ="grid" markdown>

<div markdown>
- **Co-develop analysis ideas and approaches** <br/> Participate in discussions with Data Lab members and other contributors to shape analysis ideas and select the best approaches to implement analyses.
</div>

<div markdown>
- **Write reproducible code to perform analyses** <br/> Work on an analysis module within a reproducible research framework setup for you by the Data Lab using R or Python.
</div>

<div markdown>
- **Participate in the analytical code review process** <br/> Participate in the code review process to improve your programming skills and gain experience collaborating on a code base.
</div>

<div markdown>
- **Add your analyses to the project** <br/> Contribute your analysis to benefit the broader pediatric cancer community and build your publicly-facing portfolio of source code contributions.
