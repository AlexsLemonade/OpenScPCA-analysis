# Cell typing of Ewing sarcoma samples

## Description

This module will include code to annotate cell types in the Ewing sarcoma samples from SCPCP000015 present on the ScPCA Portal.
<!--TODO: Fill out more information of the steps involved in cell typing -->

## Usage

Please provide instructions on how to run the analysis module.
What commands are needed to execute all steps in the analysis?

## Input files

This module requires the processed `SingleCellExperiment` objects (`_processed.rds`) from SCPCP0000015.

This module also requires `references/tumor_marker_genes.tsv` which contains a list of marker genes for identifying Ewing sarcoma tumor cells.

## Output files

Please include a description of the output from your analysis, including:

- What type of files are created?
- What are the contents of the output files?
- Where are the files stored?
- Are any intermediate files generated?
If so, where are they stored?

## Software requirements

Please describe the environment system used to manage software dependencies for the module (e.g., `conda`, `renv`, `docker`).
Include the locations of any files used to set up the environment.

## Computational resources

Please indicate the computational resources that are required to run the module.
If there are specific memory, CPU, and/or GPU requirements, please state that.
