This directory contains reference files used for cell typing Ewing sarcoma samples from SCPCP000015.

## Tumor marker genes

`tumor_marker_genes.tsv` contains a list of marker genes used to identify tumor cells in previously published studies.

The marker gene list was created using gene lists from two publications:

1. https://doi.org/10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-23-0027 - Marker genes were obtained from the list in [Supplemental Methods under `Cell annotation using external data`](https://aacr.silverchair-cdn.com/aacr/content_public/journal/cancerrescommun/3/10/10.1158_2767-9764.crc-23-0027/1/crc-23-0027-s01.pdf?Expires=1716815671&Signature=JgkH5QWs1J0dVeZFTCnZzfi2eDDQHhGsYazaF2UGI5vhPIatv7egTlW-3974FeZ~hM5Ac0gqiq0oBqeenDNWgN0PbU30N9-8n0LrsUmLHA2kCzhBxiHv8D-eKPXL0dSA9H3NKb~PkqTvOeV2QSde~MpCQL~cFh2Yn2Uf9XtAwrXrGhL3nOLIdb~qWBWtQUf1u0w~zynaDsz1hMh32gV5dEQVvZ0XZ4ozc9NO8neUbNvRJk5SSgAIPmQk1WXHKZpIheUbGU2VI2HeggkprVHO0lUELcgb1MmtziupgAkjE-xRrRUtbPVLe8QTWny6QtgJ6IcoH120LbFtRIfL9nOpuA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA).

2. https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.18.576251 - Marker genes were determined to be those that were unique to Ewing sarcoma cells in Figure 1C and 1F.
Genes were chosen if they were consistently expressed across Ewign sarcoma tumor cells with little expression in non-malignant cell types.
