# Results directory

## SingleR Results

The `singler` directory contains RDS and TSV files, organized by sample id, with results from running `SingleR` from `../run-analysis.sh` with default arguments.
Each library has two inference files:

* `{library_id}_singler-annotations.tsv`: A TSV of pruned labels
* `{library_id}_singler-results.rds`: The full `SingleR` output

## Results from exploratory analyses

* The directories `singler-test_aggregated` and `singler-test_not-aggregated` contain exploratory results assessing whether to aggregate the reference before SingleR model training
  * Files in these directories were generated by `../exploratory-notebooks/generate_reference-aggregation.sh`
* The directories `singler-test_combined-tumor-n` and `singler-test_separated-tumor-n` contain exploratory results assessing whether to split `Neuroendocrine` cells into two categories based on the NBAtlas "tumor zoom"
  * Files in these directories were generated by `../exploratory-notebooks/generate_separate-tumor.sh`
