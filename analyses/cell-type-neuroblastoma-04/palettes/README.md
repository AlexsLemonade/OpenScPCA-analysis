This directory contains palettes used in module visualizations.

* `harmonized-cell-type-palette.tsv`: Color palette for cell type labels which have been harmonized to jointly plot consensus and NBAtlas labels
* `nbatlas-marker-genes-palette.tsv`: Color palette for only the NBAtlas labels, specifically considering labels in the [NBAtlas marker genes file](../references/nbatlas-marker-genes.tsv)
* `nbatlas-cell-type-palette.tsv`: Color palette for NBAtlas labels, including both "immune zoom" and non-zoom labels that may appear in the final annotations
    * Note that closely related cell types are assigned the same color (e.g. all T cells are colored identically) to reduce the overall number of colors in visualizations
