# cell-type-neuroblastoma-04 Analysis Script
# Author Name
# Date
#

# This file is a template for an analysis script written in Python.
#
# It is a good idea to start with a brief introduction to the contents of the
# script, including the purpose of the analysis, the data used, and the methods
# applied.
#
# Please also include examples of of how the script should be invoked, with any
# required arguments or options.
#
# Replace this set of comment with your own introduction, and be sure to update
# the Title, Author Name, and Date at the top of the document.
# Don't forget to rename this file as well!
#
# Include comments in your code to explain your steps and to document any
# assumptions you are making.

# Load modules
#
# Load required Python modules at the top of your script
# We have included the standard `pathlib` module and the `session_info` module
# that we will be using at the bottom of this notebook to record the versions of
# the modules used in this analysis.
#
# Do not install modules here; only load them with `import` statements.
# Avoid renaming modules with `as` statements, unless you are performing a
# standard renaming (e.g., `import pandas as pd`).
