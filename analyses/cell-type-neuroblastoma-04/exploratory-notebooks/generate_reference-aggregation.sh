# Generate results and render the template exploratory notebook `reference-aggregation.Rmd`.
# This analysis only considers a subset of samples.
# They were chosen to have a range in number of cells, diversity of consensus cell type annotations, and diversity in tech/sequencing units.
# SCPCS000104: nucleus, 10Xv2
# SCPCS000105: cell, 10Xv2
# SCPCS000108: cell, 10Xv3

### note that SCPCS000109 has two libraries but we only consider one of them (skip SCPCL000127)
# SCPCS000111: nucleus, 10Xv3.1
