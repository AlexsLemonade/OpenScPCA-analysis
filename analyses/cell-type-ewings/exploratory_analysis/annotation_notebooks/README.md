# Cell type annotations

This folder contains exploratory notebooks used to generate final annotations for each sample and library in `SCPCP000015`.
Inside each sample folder will be a set of notebooks used to validate the final annotations.
The TSV file containing the annotations with one row per barcode can be found in `results/annotation_tables`.
Note that currently, only tumor cell classification is included in the annotations TSV.
