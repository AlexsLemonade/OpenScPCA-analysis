# Cell type annotations

This folder contains TSV files with the final annotations for each sample and library in `SCPCP000015`.
Each sample has it's own folder that contains the final annotations for each library.

Inside each sample folder will be a set of notebooks used to validate the final annotations and a TSV file containing the annotations with one row per barcode.
Note that currently, only tumor cell classification is included in the annotations TSV.
