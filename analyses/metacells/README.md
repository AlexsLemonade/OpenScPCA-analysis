# Metacell Analysis Module

This module explores the use of metacells in the ScPCA context.
This will include both processing of the data and some comparisons among different methods.

## Description

Initially, this module will contain some scripts and notebooks for applying analysis methods to the data.

## Usage

TBD

## Input files

Initial analysis is expected use processed `SingleCellExperiment` objects from the ScPCA Portal, in AnnData format.

For initial testtesting, files were downloaded with:
```
./download-data.py --format "anndata" --projects SCPCP000001


## Output files

TBD

## Software requirements

Currently, software requirements are handled by conda, with the environment.yml file in this directory and the conda environment named `openscpca-metacells`

## Computational resources

TBD
