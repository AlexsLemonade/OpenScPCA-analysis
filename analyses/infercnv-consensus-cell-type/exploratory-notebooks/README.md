* `01_ewings-consensus-cell-types.Rmd` explores the distribution of immune cells across samples in `SCPCP000015` to determine approaches for creating a pooled normal reference
* `02_ewings-reference-cnv.Rmd` explores the distribution of inferred total CNV in pooled normal reference cells across samples in `SCPCP000015`
* `03_ewings-pooled-internal.Rmd` compares results from `SCPCP000015` samples that were able to be processed with both internal and pooled normal references
