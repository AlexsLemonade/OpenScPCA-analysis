# Normal references

This directory stores RDS files with SCE objects to use as normal cell references with `inferCNV`, organized by project.
The RDS files are not stored in version control due to their large size.
Each project directory will also have a TSV tile listing all of the consensus cell types included in each reference, which is included in version control.

All files are created by project-specific scripts found in `../../scripts/build-normal-reference/`.
