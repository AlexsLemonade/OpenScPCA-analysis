# Wilms Tumor Dataset Annotation (SCPCP000006)

Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common pediatric kidney cancer characterized by an exacerbated intra- and inter- tumor heterogeneity.
The genetic landscape of WT is very diverse in each of the histological contingents.
The COG classifies WT patients into two groups: the favorable histology and diffuse anaplasia.
Each of these groups is composed of the blastemal, epithelial, and stromal populations of cancer cells in different proportions, as well as cells from the normal kidney, mostly kidney epithelial cells, endothelial cells, immune cells and normal stromal cells (fibroblast).
