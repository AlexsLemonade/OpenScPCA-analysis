# Notebook directory instructions

The notebook directory holds subdirectory for each of the sample in the Wilms tumor dataset SCPCP000006 and the fetal kidney reference that we used for label transfer. 

## Azimuth compatible fetal kidney reference

To perform label transfer using Azimuth and the fetal kidney atlas, a reference is built via [`scripts/download-and-create-fetal-kidney-ref.R`](../scripts/download-and-create-fetal-kidney-ref.R) using the fetal_full.Rds object download from:
"https://datasets.cellxgene.cziscience.com/40ebb8e4-1a25-4a33-b8ff-02d1156e4e9b.rds"

As part of the `00b_characterize_fetal_kidney_reference_Stewart.Rmd` notebook template, we characterized the fetal kidney reference and generated lists of marker genes for the compartment and cell types composing the reference. 


## Analysis per sample

Each of the sample of the Wilms tumor dataset SCPCP000006 as been pre-processed and characterized as the following. 
Reports for each of the steps are found in the notebook/{sample_id} directory:

- `01_seurat_processing_{sample-id}.html` is the output of the [`01_seurat-processing.Rmd`](../notebook_template/01_seurat-processing.Rmd) notebook template.
In brief, the `_processed.rds` `sce object` is converted to `Seurat` and normalized using `SCTransform`.
Dimensionality reduction (`RunPCA` and `RunUMAP`) and clustering (`FindNeighbors` and `FindClusters`) are performed before saving the `Seurat` object. 

- `02a_fetal_full_label-transfer_{sample-id}.html` is the output of the [`02a_label-transfer_fetal_full_reference_Cao.Rmd`](../notebook_template/02a_label-transfer_fetal_full_reference_Cao.Rmd) notebook template.
In brief, we used `Azimuth` to transfer labels from the `Azimuth` fetal full reference (Cao et al.) 

- `02b_fetal_kidney_label-transfer_{sample-id}.html` is the output of the [`02b_label-transfer_fetal_kidney_reference_Stewart.Rmd`](../notebook_template/02b_label-transfer_fetal_kidney_reference_Stewart.Rmd) notebook template.
In brief, we used `Azimuth` to transfer labels from the fetal kidney reference (Stewart et al.) 

- `03_clustering_exploration_{sample-id}.html` is the output of the [`03_clustering_exploration.Rmd`](../notebook_template/03_clustering_exploration.Rmd) notebook template.
In brief, we explore the clustering results, we look into some marker genes, pathways enrichment and label transfer.


## Global analysis

The next step in analysis is to identify tumor vs. normal cells.

- `04_annotation_Across_Samples_exploration.html` is the output of the [`04_annotation_Across_Samples_exploration.Rmd`](../notebook/04_annotation_Across_Samples_exploration.Rmd) notebook. 
In brief, we explored the label transfer results across all samples in the Wilms tumor dataset SCPCP000006 in order to identify a few samples that we can begin next analysis steps with.

## Exploratory analysis

We selected in [`04_annotation_Across_Samples_exploration.Rmd`](../notebook/04_annotation_Across_Samples_exploration.Rmd) 5 samples to test for aneuploidy and CNV inference:
- sample SCPCS000194 has > 85 % of cells predicted as kidney and 234 + 83 endothelium and immune cells.
- sample SCPCS000179 has > 94 % of cells predicted as kidney and 25 + 111 endothelium and immune cells.
- sample SCPCS000184 has > 96 % of cells predicted as kidney and 39 + 70 endothelium and immune cells.
- sample SCPCS000205 has > 89 % of cells predicted as kidney and 92 + 76 endothelium and immune cells.
- sample SCPCS0000208 has > 95 % of cells predicted as kidney and 18 + 35 endothelium and immune cells.

We wanted to test `copykat` results obtained with or without normal cells as reference, using either an euclidean or statistical (spearman) method for CNV heatmap clustering. 
This impact the final decision made by `copykat` for each cell to be either aneuploid or diploid, and it is thus crucial to explore the results using the different methods.
For each of the selected samples, we explore the results in the template `notebook` [`05_copykat_exploration.Rmd`](../notebook_template/05_copykat_exploration.Rmd), which creates a notebook `05_cnv_copykat_exploration_{sample_id}.html` for each sample.
These `notebooks` are inspired by the plots written for the Ewing Sarcoma analysis in [`03-copykat.Rmd`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis/blob/main/analyses/cell-type-ewings/exploratory_analysis/03-copykat.Rmd).
