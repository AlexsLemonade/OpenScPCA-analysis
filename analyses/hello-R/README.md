# Hello R

This is an example analysis module using an R notebook to perform a simple analysis of the OpenScPCA data.

The analysis counts the number of cells in each processed SCE file in the current data directory.

## Usage

To run the analysis, run the following command from this analysis directory:

```bash
bash hello-R.sh
```

### Output

- `notebooks/hello.nb.html`: a rendered R Markdown notebook
- `results/cell_counts.csv`: a table of counts for each library
- `plots/cell_counts.pdf`: histograms of cell counts by project

```

```
