# Results directory instructions

Files in the results directory should not be directly committed to the repository.

Instead, results that are to be shared for review should be copied to an S3 bucket and a link to the S3 location should be added to this README file.

In the case of this example module, no S3 bucket is currently defined, so no link is available.
