# This is a workflow to run the {{ openscpca_module }} module
#
# Analysis modules are run based on three triggers:
# - Manual trigger
# - On pull requests where code in the module has changed
# - As a reusable workflow called from a separate workflow which periodically runs all modules
#
# At initialization, only the manual trigger is active
