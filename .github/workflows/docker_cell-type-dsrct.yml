# This is a workflow to build the docker image for the cell-type-dsrct module
#
# Docker modules are run on pull requests when code for files that affect the Docker image have changed.
# If other files are used during the Docker build, they should be added to `paths`
#
# At module initialization, this workflow is inactive, and needs to be activated manually
