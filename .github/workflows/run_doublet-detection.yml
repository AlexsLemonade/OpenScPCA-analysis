# This is a workflow to run the doublet-detection module
# This module has both an renv and a conda environment
#
# Analysis modules are run based on three triggers:
# - Manual trigger
# - On pull requests where code in the module has changed
# - As a reusable workflow called from a separate workflow which periodically runs all modules

env:
  MODULE_PATH: analyses/doublet-detection

  # use all samples for testing unless this is triggered by a PR, in which case only use a subset of samples for faster testing
